## What is this?

I'm rewriting my private memo app with more 'buiding my own web framework' in mind.
Primary purpose is to be more confident about architecture of web apps.

## So far what's going on?

* read through [Hanami (fka Lotus) framework](http://hanamirb.org/)
* extract key domain components from my old spaghetti codebase
* rewrite them with plain Ruby objects
* when I need to implement "business-logic-independent" features to my app, encapsulate them to different modules
* maybe they will become another web framework
